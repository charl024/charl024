# ðŸ’« About Me:
Hi! I'm Charles, a developer passionate about GPU programming, embedded systems, and high-performance computing.<br><br>Most of my work revolves around building real-time systems, whether it be accelerated image processing pipelines in CUDA or exploring new ways to speed up my programs.<br><br>On the side, I enjoy working with microcontrollers and hardware components to build custom keyboards, from circuit board design to custom firmware development. 

Most of my work isnâ€™t publicly available due to project constraints and confidentiality.
